### Version 1.00
### Current User, All Hosts - Windows - $HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1
### This file should be stored in $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
### If $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts doesn't exist, you can make one with the following:
### New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts -Force
### This will create the file and the containing subdirectory if it doesn't already
